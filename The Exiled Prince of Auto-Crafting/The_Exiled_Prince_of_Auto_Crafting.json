  "description": "Third Prince Theodulf has been banished to a wasteland known as the Land of Death because he didn’t receive a gift from the Goddess. It’s a barren land where the air is so noxious, nothing can grow there. Surviving there is impossible… or so everyone thought! As it turns out, Theodulf is a reincarnated being and has received a power known as “Auto-Craft” from the Goddess. Using this powerful gift to automatically create everything, the prince proceeds to turn the Land of Death into one brimming with life!! Source: K Manga",
