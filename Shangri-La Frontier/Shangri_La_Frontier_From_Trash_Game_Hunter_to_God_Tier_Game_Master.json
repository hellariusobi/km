  "description": "Second-year high school student Rakuro Hizutome loves nothing more than finding so-called “trash games” and beating the crap out of them. When he decides to change things up by playing a new, “god-tier” VR game known as Shangri-La Frontier (a.k.a. SLF), he does what he does best: min-maxes, skips the prologue, and jumps straight into action! Rakuro may be a seasoned gamer, but a meeting with an old rival will change the fate of every SLF player forever.",
