  "title": "Let’s Take a Walk in Another World",
  "description": "Sora was summoned into a fantasy world from his native Japan to be a hero…but the only special skill he has is \"Walking\"! Its effect? \"Walk as much as you want without getting tired.\" It sounds convenient, but it won't help in the fight against the demon lord! Rejected for his weakness, he's dumped outside the palace by the king's guards. But as he begins to walk away, he suddenly levels up! Each step taken earns one experience point…and soon, useful skills like Examine, Alchemy, and Domestic Magic are his to command! Who knew just taking a walk could be the key to a whole new world?",
