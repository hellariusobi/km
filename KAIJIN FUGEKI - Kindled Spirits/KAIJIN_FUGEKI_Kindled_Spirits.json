  "description": "Night, phenomena that were once known as natural disasters. Faced with the threat of inexplicable destruction, children offer their prayers in the form of dance in order to borrow the power of the gods, quell the Night's fury, and deliver the world from ruin. In a fateful encounter, a boy from a rural town in Japan, Jin, meets Gao, a British soldier who was forced to flee his homeland by the Night. The two spend their halcyon days with their friends in the quiet town surrounded by nature. Until one day, the Night suddenly falls on them once again!",
