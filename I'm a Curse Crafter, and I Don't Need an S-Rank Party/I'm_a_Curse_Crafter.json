  "description": "Gail Hamilton is a “curse crafter“ who got booted from his party for allegedly not pulling his weight...right after they were promoted to the Guild's “S“ rank. Unfortunately, the party didn't realize that Gail's cursed goods pack the power of holy relics and legendary gear! But too bad for them, because Gail's going it alone now...and causing a sensation with the creepy-yet-useful curses he works with!",
